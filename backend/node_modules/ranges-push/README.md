## Install

```bash
npm i ranges-push
```

The [_default_](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html#_default-exports-one-per-module) is exported, so instead of "`Ranges`" below, you can name the consumed function however you want.

Consume via a `require()`:

```js
const Ranges = require("ranges-push");
```

or as an ES Module:

```js
import Ranges from "ranges-push";
```

or for web pages, as a production-ready minified script file (so-called "UMD build"), straight from CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ranges-push/dist/ranges-push.umd.js"></script>
```

```js
// in which case you get a global variable "rangesPush" which you consume like this:
const Ranges = rangesPush;
```

This package has three builds in `dist/` folder:

| Type                                                                                                    | Key in `package.json` | Path                      | Size  |

## Use it

```js
const Ranges = require("ranges-push");
let ranges = new Ranges();
ranges.add(1, 2);
ranges.push(2, 4); // .push is same as .add
console.log(ranges.last());
// => [ [1, 4] ]
ranges.add(10, 20);
console.log(ranges.current());
// => [ [1, 4], [10, 20] ]
```

## The Idea

Imagine, you want to delete bunch of characters from a string. Like making a bunch of holes in a slice of cheese. An ineffective way is to traverse that string and mutate it on each "hole". The effective way is to gather the indexes of `[from, to]` ranges in an array while traversing, and when string traversal is done, perform all cutting **in one go**. It's like using ten pencils to make ten holes in a slice, all at once. OK, bad example, but you get it. All in one go. That's the plan.

**Challenge: how do you manage those string index ranges?**

`[deleteFromIndex1, deleteToIndex1]`, `[deleteFromIndex2, deteleToIndex2]` and so on.

- What happens when ranges overlap? We need to merge them.
- What happens if new range is located before the last one? We need to sort them.
- How do you prevent damage when the same range is added multiple times?
- What happens if you want not only to delete but also, **to add** something? We need to accept the third argument, the value to add.
- What happens if you want to only add something, without deletion? We need to accept the first and second argument as the same index.

---

**The solution to all these challenges above is...** this library.

---

**PS.** Later, when you're finished with your operations, and you want your string crunched according to your newly-generated array of ranges, use [ranges-apply](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/ranges-apply) to do the actual deletion/replacement job. It consumes your ranges array and performs all the deletion/replacement tasks on the string at once.

## API

This package exports a constructor, Ranges, which you first `require()`, then call using `new`:

```js
const Ranges = require("ranges-push");
let ranges = new Ranges();
// or, with Optional Options Object:
let ranges = new Ranges({ limitToBeAddedWhitespace: true });
let ranges = new Ranges({ mergeType: 2 });
```

The `ranges` (with lowercase) is your [class](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/es6%20%26%20beyond/ch3.md#classes) which contains your slice ranges and gives you methods to get/set the values.

You can also provide an Optional Options Object when creating the class:

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

### Optional Options Object

| options object's key       | Type of its value | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {                          |                   |         |
| `limitToBeAddedWhitespace` | Boolean           | `false` | If set to `true`, if to-be-added string (3rd element in the range array) contains only whitespace (`trim()`s to empty string), replace it with: either line break `\n` (if there's at least one line break or `\r` in it) or with a single space (all other cases). Same applies when we have a string, surrounded by whitespace. That whitespace will be replaced with space or line break. |
| `limitLinebreaksCount`     | Number            | `1`     | This is the number of maximum consecutive line breaks allowed in collapsed result. Practically, setting this to `2` would allow single blank lines in the output (for example, between paragraphs).                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `mergeType`                | Number            | `1`     | Default mode, `1` is concatenate clashing values, but alternative mode `2` is newer value overwrites older. See detailed explanation [below](#optsmergetype)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| }                          |                   |         |

The Optional Options Object is validated by [check-types-mini](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/check-types-mini), so please behave: the settings' values have to match the API and settings object should not have any extra keys, not defined in the API. Naughtiness will cause error `throw`s. I know, it's strict, but it prevents any API misconfigurations and helps to identify some errors early-on.

Here is the Optional Options Object in one place (in case you ever want to copy it):

```js
{
  limitToBeAddedWhitespace: false,
  limitLinebreaksCount: 1,
  mergeType: 1
}
```

You then interact with your newly-created ranges class by calling its _methods_:

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

## `opts.mergeType`

When merging, ranges are sorted first. Then, pairs starting from the end of the sorted array are merged. Last two becomes one, last two becomes one and so on.

The challenge is, what to do with values to add, third range array's element.

For example,

```js
const range1 = [1, 2, "a"];
const range2 = [1, 2, "b"];
```

The above ranges are "saying": replace characters in a string from index `1` to `2` with `"a"`, replace characters in string from index `1` to `2` with `"b"`.

Do we end up with `"ab"` or `"b"` or something else?

`opts.mergeType` let's you customise this behaviour:

- In default mode, opts.mergeType === `1`, clashing "to insert" values will always be concatenated (`"ab"` in example above)
- In mode opts.mergeType === `2`, if "to insert" values clash and **starting indexes are the same** — the latter value overrides the former (`"b"` in example above).

In all other aspects, `opts.mergeType` modes `1` and `2` are the same.

Practically, you activate the mode when you create the class:

```js
const Ranges = require("ranges-push");
let rangesArr = new Ranges({ mergeType: 2 });
```

From there on, when you push to `rangesArr`, clashing values will be resolved according to "mergeType" rules.

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

### ranges.add(from, to[, str])

alias - **.push**

| Input argument | Type                    | Obligatory? | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deleteFrom`   | Integer, natural number | yes         | Beginning index of the slice                                                                                                                        |
| `deleteTo`     | Integer, natural number | yes         | Ending index of the slice                                                                                                                           |
| `str`          | String                  | no          | If you want not only to delete but [insert](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/ranges-apply) something, put that new string here |

If you want only to insert and you don't want to delete anything, put both `deleteFrom` and `deleteTo` **the same**.

- If the arguments are of a wrong type, it will `throw` and error.
- Also, if you _overload_ it, providing fourth, fifth input argument and so on if will `throw` too. It's for your safety because it might flag up something wrong happening in your code.

In essence, `.add()` behaves two ways:

1.  `.add(1, 2)`, later `.add(2, 3)` will not create a new `[2, 3]` but extend `[1, 2]` into `[1, 3]`. This is to save time because we prevent bunch of connecting ranges from being recorded as separate ones.
2.  all other cases, if it's not an exact extension of a previous range, new range is added into the array. `.add(2, 3)`, later `.add(1, 2)` will result in `[ [2, 3], [1, 2] ]`. The `.current()` method will clean it later. Read on...

Additionally, when `.add` merges two ranges and one completely overlaps another, the superset (larger) range will wipe out any "to-add" (third-argument) values of the subset (smaller) range(s).

You can use either `.add` or `.push`, both do the same thing.

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

### ranges.current()

This method fetches the **current** state of your ranges array, sorts and **merges it**, then outputs it to you.

Result is either

1.  array of slice range arrays like:

```js
[
  // notice it's an array of arrays
  [10, 20, " insert this string after deleting range between indexes 10 & 20"][
    (30, 50)
  ],
  [51, 55],
];
```

2.  or `null` if it's still empty and nothing has been added since.

`.current()` will do the sorting first by `deleteFrom` (first element), then, sorting by `deleteTo` (second element), **then**, it will merge any ranges that overlap.

```js
[[4, 5], [1, 2]] => [[1, 2], [4, 5]] // no overlap, so just sorted by 1st element
```

```js
[[2, 5], [2, 3], [1, 10]] => [[1, 10]] // there was an overlap, so ranges were merged
```

In theory, since `.current()` does not mutate our ranges array in the memory, you could add more ranges and call `.current()` again, this time possibly with a slightly different result. However, be aware that merging will lose some of the data in the ranges.

Imagine: `[ [10, 20, 'aaa'], [10, 15, bbb]]` was merged by `.current`, and became `[ [10, 20, 'bbbaaa'] ]`. Now if you use this range in [ranges-apply](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/ranges-apply) to amend the string, but then later discover that you left out the range `[12, 17, ccc]`, that is, you wanted to delete between indexes 12 and 17, and then insert `ccc`, you'll be in trouble. Since you amended your string, you can't "stick in" `ccc` between original `bbb` and `aaa` — your desired place to add `ccc`, at index 17 has been "merged" by `bbb` and `aaa`.

**Conclusion**: complete all your operations, `add()`-ing ranges. Then, fetch your master ranges array _once_, using `.current` and feed it into [ranges-apply](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/ranges-apply). At this point don't do any more `add()`ing, or if you really want that, process the ranges you've got using [ranges-apply](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/ranges-apply), `wipe()` everything and start `add()`ing again.

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

### ranges.wipe()

Sets your ranges array to `null`. Right after that `ranges.current()` will yield `null`. You can then start `add`-ing again, from scratch.

### ranges.replace(newRanges)

If you have a new set of ranges and you want to replace existing set, instead of using `ranges.wipe()` and then iterating through all new ranges and adding them one-by-one, you can simple replace everything using `ranges.replace()`. For example:

```js
const oldRanges = new Ranges();
oldRanges.add(1, 2, "a");
oldRanges.add(3, 4, "b");
oldRanges.add(9, 10);
console.log(oldRanges.current());
// => [[1, 2, "a"], [3, 4, "b"], [9, 10]]

// now replace them with new ranges:
oldRanges.replace([[6, 8, "zzz"]]);
console.log(oldRanges.current());
// => [[6, 8, "zzz"]]
```

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

### ranges.last()

Outputs:

1.  the last ranges' array from the ranges array, for example:

```js
[51, 55];
```

2.  Or, if there's nothing in the ranges array yet, `null`.

---

PSST. Later, feed your ranges array into [ranges-apply](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/ranges-apply) to delete/replace all those ranges in your string.

## In my case

Originally this library was part of [email-comb](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/email-comb), but I tore it off and placed into a separate (this) library when I needed the same function in [html-img-alt](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/html-img-alt). Since then, [Detergent](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/detergent) also uses it, so its unit test wouldn't take an hour, calculating all possible combinations of the options, while input string is mutated again and again in the for a loop.

This library is part one of two library combo, second one being [ranges-apply](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/ranges-apply).

We'll try to help.
- If you want to contribute some code, fork the [monorepo](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/) via GitLab, then write code, then file a pull request on GitLab. We'll merge it in and release.

In monorepo, npm libraries are located in `packages/` folder. Inside, the source code is located either in `src/` folder (normal npm library) or in the root, `cli.js` (if it's a command-line application).

The npm script "`dev`", the `"dev": "rollup -c --dev"` builds the development version retaining all `console.log`s with row numbers. It's handy to have [js-row-num-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-row-num-cli) installed globally so you can automatically update the row numbers on all `console.log`s.
