## Install

```bash
npm i string-strip-html
```

The [_default_](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html#_default-exports-one-per-module) is exported, so instead of "`stripHtml`" below, you can name the consumed function however you want.

Consume via a `require()`:

```js
const stripHtml = require("string-strip-html");
```

or as an ES Module:

```js
import stripHtml from "string-strip-html";
```

or for web pages, as a production-ready minified script file (so-called "UMD build"), straight from CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/string-strip-html/dist/string-strip-html.umd.js"></script>
```

```js
// in which case you get a global variable "stringStripHtml" which you consume like this:
const stripHtml = stringStripHtml;
```

This package has three builds in `dist/` folder:

## Use it

```js
const stripHtml = require("string-strip-html");
// it does not assume the output must be always HTML and detects legit brackets:
console.log(stripHtml("a < b and c > d")); // => 'a < b and c > d'
// leaves content between tags:
console.log(stripHtml("Some text <b>and</b> text.")); // => 'Some text and text.'
// adds spaces to prevent accidental string concatenation
console.log(stripHtml("aaa<div>bbb</div>ccc")); // => 'aaa bbb ccc'
```

## Purpose

This library only detects and removes HTML tags from strings (text, in other words). Not more, not less. If something is deemed to be not a tag, it will not be removed. The bar is set higher than browsers - we aim to tackle as much broken code as possible so that later everything will work on browsers. This library is a development tool.

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

## Features

- Can be used to generate Email Text versions. Optionally, any URL links can be extracted and put after a previously-linked element.
- Works when opening or closing tag bracket is missing on some tags.
- It can detect and skip false positives, for example, `a < b and c > d`.
- Works on dirty code - duplicate brackets, whitespace after opening bracket, messed up closing slashes — you name it — everything will be stripped.
- Adds spaces or line breaks to prevent concatenation. Except where punctuation characters follow.
- Can remove tags with all the content between opening and closing tag, for example `<style>...</style>` or `<script>...</script>`
- Uses recursive HTML decoding, so there's no way to cheat this library by using any kind of HTML encoding (unless you turn the decoding off via `opts.skipHtmlDecoding`)
- It doesn't assume anything about the input source or purpose of the output string

### Opts Validation

The Optional Options Object is not validated; please take care of what values and of what type you pass.

Here is the Optional Options Object in one place (in case you ever want to copy it whole):

```js
{
  ignoreTags: [],
  onlyStripTags: [],
  stripTogetherWithTheirContents: ["script", "style", "xml"],
  skipHtmlDecoding: false,
  returnRangesOnly: false,
  trimOnlySpaces: false,
  dumpLinkHrefsNearby: {
    enabled: false,
    putOnNewLine: false,
    wrapHeads: "",
    wrapTails: ""
  }
}
```

### API - Output

A string of zero or more characters, with all HTML entities (both _named_, like `&nbsp;` and _numeric_, like `&#x20;`) recursively decoded. _Recursive decoding_ means that twice-encoded `&amp;nbsp;` would still get decoded. There's no way the tags can get past with the help of encoding.

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

## Options

### `opts.returnRangesOnly`

If you construct development tools, different libraries perform separate steps, and it's inefficient to transform the input string during each step. It's better to keep a _note_ what needs to be done, supplementing or editing notes along the pipeline. Finally, when the end is reached, _notes_ are used to process the result string.

Notes can be stored as _ranges_ - it's a fancy name for arrays of three arguments: `beginIndex`, `endIndex` and `whatToInsert`. First two correspond to [String.prototype.slice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice) first two arguments. The third argument signifies what will be put in place of this string slice: if it's `undefined` (missing argument) or empty string — that slice will be deleted. If it's a string, its value will be placed instead of a deleted slice.

All our [_range_- class libraries](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen#-range-libraries) adhere to this spec.

Now, `string-strip-html` can also return ranges instead of a final string.

**PS.** If you wonder how [Unicode problem](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-unicode) affects _ranges_ concept — the answer is — they are not related. As long as you use JavaScript, all strings will use native JS string index system, the same which ranges use. Now it's your challenge to put _correct_ ranges that mean intended string pieces.

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

### `opts.trimOnlySpaces`

> `Hi&nbsp;` &rarr; `Hi&nbsp;` instead of `Hi&nbsp;` &rarr; `Hi`

When using this tool in an automated fashion, for example, to process JSON, few JSON fields might comprise a single string. Often there are considerations on how that string is assembled. For example, imagine we "stitch" the sentence: `Hi John! Welcome to our club.` out of three pieces: `Hi` + `John` + `! + Welcome to our club.`. In this case, spaces between the chunks would be added by your templating engine. Now, imagine, the text is of a quite large `font-size`, and there's a risk of words wrapping at wrong places. A client asks you to ensure that `Hi` and `John` are **never split between the lines**.

What do you do?

You remove the space between `Hi` and `John` from the template and move it to data-level. You hard-code the non-breaking space after `Hi` — `Hi&nbsp;`.

As you know, this library trims the input before returning it, and recursive HTML decoding is always on. On default settings, this library would remove your non-breaking space from `Hi&nbsp;`. That's where you need to set `opts.trimOnlySpaces` to `true`.

In this particular case, you can either turn off HTML decoding OR, even better, use this `opts.trimOnlySpaces` setting.

In either case, whitespace between the detected tags will still be aggressively trimmed - `text <div>\n \t \r\n <br>\t \t \t</div> here` &rarr; `text here`.

When this setting is on, only spaces will be trimmed from outside; an algorithm will stop at a first non-space character, in this case, non-breaking space:

```
"      &nbsp;     Hi! Please <div>shop now</div>!      &nbsp;      "
```

is turned into:

```
"&nbsp;     Hi! Please shop now!      &nbsp;"
```

Notice how space chunks between `nbsp`'s and text are retained when `opts.trimOnlySpaces` is set to `true`. But the default is `false`; this feature is off by default.

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

### `opts.dumpLinkHrefsNearby`

This feature is aimed at producing Text versions for promotional or transactional email campaigns.

If input string is has a linked text, URL will be put after it:

```html
I watch both <a href="https://www.rt.com" target="_blank">RT</a> and
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk" target="_blank">BBC</a>.
```

it's turned into:

```html
I watch both RT https://www.rt.com and BBC https://www.bbc.co.uk.
```

But equally, any link on any tag, even one without text, will be retained:

```html
Codsen
<div>
  <a href="https://codsen.com" target="_blank"
    ><img
      src="logo.png"
      width="100"
      height="100"
      border="0"
      style="display:block;"
      alt="Codsen logo"
  /></a>
</div>
```

it's turned into:

```
Codsen https://codsen.com
```

This feature is off by default; you need to turn it on, passing options object with a key `opts.dumpLinkHrefsNearby` set to `true`.

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

### `opts.onlyStripTags`

Sometimes you want to strip only certain HTML tag or tags. It would be impractical to ignore all other known HTML tags and leave those you want. Option `opts.onlyStripTags` allows inverting the setting: whatever tags you list will be the only tags removed.

`opts.onlyStripTags` is an array. When a program starts, it will filter out any empty strings and strings that can be `String.trim()`'ed to zero-length string. It's necessary because a presence on just one string in `opts.onlyStripTags` will switch this application to `delete-only-these` mode and it would be bad if empty, falsey or whitespace string value would accidentally cause it.

This option can work in combination with `opts.ignoreTags`. Any tags listed in `opts.ignoreTags` will be removed from the tags, listed in `opts.onlyStripTags`. If there was one or more tag listed in `opts.onlyStripTags`, the `delete-only-these` mode will be on and will be respected, even if there will be no tags to remove because all were excluded in `opts.onlyStripTags`.

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

### `opts.cb`

Sometimes you want more control over the program: maybe you want to strip only certain tags and write your custom conditions, maybe you want to do something extra on tags which are being ignored, for example, fix whitespace within them?

You can get this level of control using `opts.cb`. In options object, under key's `cb` value, put a function. Whenever this program wants to do something, it will call your function, `Array.forEach(key => {})`-style. Instead of `key` you get a plain object with the following keys:

```js
const cb = ({
  tag,
  deleteFrom,
  deleteTo,
  insert,
  rangesArr,
  proposedReturn,
}) => {
  // default action which does nothing different from normal, non-callback operation
  rangesArr.push(deleteFrom, deleteTo, insert);
  // you might want to do something different, depending on "tag" contents.
};
const result = stripHtml("abc<hr>def", { cb });
```

The `tag` key contains all the internal data for the particular tag which is being removed. Feel free to `console.log(JSON.stringify(tag, null, 4))` it and tap its contents.

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

### cb() example one

The point of this callback interface is to pass the action of pushing of ranges to a user, as opposed to a program. The program will suggest you what it would push to final ranges array, but it's up to you to perform the pushing.

Below, the program "does nothing", that is, you push what it proposes, "proposedReturn" array:

```js
const cb = ({
  tag,
  deleteFrom,
  deleteTo,
  insert,
  rangesArr,
  proposedReturn,
}) => {
  rangesArr.push(deleteFrom, deleteTo, insert);
};
const res1 = stripHtml("abc<hr>def", { cb });
console.log(res1);
// => "abc def"

// you can request ranges instead:
const res2 = stripHtml("abc<hr>def", { returnRangesOnly: true, cb });
console.log(res2);
// => [[3, 7, " "]]
```

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

### cb() example two

In the example below, we are going to use one of the keys of the `tag`, the `tag.slashPresent` which tells is there a closing slash on this tag or not.

For example, considering input with some rogue whitspace, `<div >abc</ div>`, replace all `div` with `tralala`, minding the closing slash:

```js
const stripHtml = require("string-strip-html");
// define a callback as a separate variable if you are going to use it multiple times:
const cb = ({
  tag,
  deleteFrom,
  deleteTo,
  // insert,
  rangesArr,
  // proposedReturn
}) => {
  rangesArr.push(
    deleteFrom,
    deleteTo,
    `<${tag.slashPresent ? "/" : ""}tralala>`
  );
};
const res1 = stripHtml("<div >abc</ div>", { cb });
console.log(`res1 = "${res1}"`);
// res1 = "<tralala>abc</tralala>"

const res2 = stripHtml("<div >abc</ div>", {
  returnRangesOnly: true,
  cb,
});
console.log(`res2 = ${JSON.stringify(res2, null, 4)}`);
// res2 = [
//   [0, 6, "<tralala>"],
//   [9, 16, "</tralala>"]
// ]
```

## Algorithm

This program does not use AST's because we want to strip broken HTML or HTML mixed with other sources (which throws parsers). This program does not use a parser, it works from lexer-level (precisely speaking, it's a _scanerless_ parser algorithm).

We'll try to help.
- If you want to contribute some code, fork the [monorepo](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/) via GitLab, then write code, then file a pull request on GitLab. We'll merge it in and release.

In monorepo, npm libraries are located in `packages/` folder. Inside, the source code is located either in `src/` folder (normal npm library) or in the root, `cli.js` (if it's a command-line application).

The npm script "`dev`", the `"dev": "rollup -c --dev"` builds the development version retaining all `console.log`s with row numbers. It's handy to have [js-row-num-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-row-num-cli) installed globally so you can automatically update the row numbers on all `console.log`s.
