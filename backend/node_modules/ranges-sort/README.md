## Install

```bash
npm i ranges-sort
```

The [_default_](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html#_default-exports-one-per-module) is exported, so instead of "`rsort`" below, you can name the consumed function however you want.

Consume via a `require()`:

```js
const rsort = require("ranges-sort");
```

or as an ES Module:

```js
import rsort from "ranges-sort";
```

or for web pages, as a production-ready minified script file (so-called "UMD build"), straight from CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ranges-sort/dist/ranges-sort.umd.js"></script>
```

```js
// in which case you get a global variable "rangesSort" which you consume like this:
const rsort = rangesSort;
```

This package has three builds in `dist/` folder:

| Type                                                                                                    | Key in `package.json` | Path                      | Size |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ---- |
| Main export - **CommonJS version**, transpiled to ES5, contains `require` and `module.exports`          | `main`                | `dist/ranges-sort.cjs.js` | 4 KB |
| **ES module** build that Webpack/Rollup understands. Untranspiled ES6 code with `import`/`export`.      | `module`              | `dist/ranges-sort.esm.js` | 2 KB |
| **UMD build** for browsers, transpiled, minified, containing `iife`'s and has all dependencies baked-in | `browser`             | `dist/ranges-sort.umd.js` | 2 KB |

## What it does

Background: strings in JavaScript consist of characters. For example, `abc` is a string. Each character has an index number and the numbering starts from zero. For example, in "abc", "a" has index `0`, "b" has index `1` and so on.

We use arrays to **mark what to delete** from a string, from example, deletion from index `0` to index `5` would be `[0, 5]`. If we added a third element, that would mean we want to **insert it**, replacing the given index range. For example, if a string is `abc` and we want to delete "b", that would be range `[1, 2]`. If we wanted to replace "b" with "x", that would be range `[1, 2, "x"]`.

Now, if you have _an array_ of such ranges (that's an _array of arrays_), this library can **sort them**. For example:

```js
[ [5, 6], [1, 3] ] => [ [1, 3], [5, 6] ]
[ [5, 6], [5, 3], [5, 0] ] => [ [5, 0], [5, 3], [5, 6] ]
[] => []

[[1, 2], []] => // throws, because there's at least one empty range
[['a']] => // throws, because range is not a range but a string
[[1], [2]] => // throws, because one index is not a range

// 3rd argument and onwards are ignored:
[[3, 4, 'aaa', 'bbb'], [1, 2, 'zzz']] => [[1, 2, 'zzz'], [3, 4, 'aaa', 'bbb']]
```

This is a specialised library to sort these types of arrays, not any type of arrays. We expect first two elements in each array to be a natural number and there can be optional third argument (of any type).

The purpose of string index ranges is to avoid changing a string many times but instead, track the changes (ranges of indexes), compiling them in an array, and later perform all changes in one go. This guarantees the original characters in the string retain the original positions throughout the whole operation. It's easier and faster to process strings this way.

The purpose of _range sorting_ is to make life easier for other range-processing libraries.

## API

**rsort(arr[, opts])** — in other words, this library gives you a _function_ and you must feed an array into its first argument and also if you wish, you can feed a second argument, the _Optional Options Object_ (bracket in `[, opts]` means "optional").

| Input argument | Type         | Obligatory? | Description                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arrOfRanges`  | Array        | yes         | Array of zero or more arrays meaning natural number ranges (2 elements each) |
| `opts`         | Plain object | no          | Optional options go here.                                                    |

For example,

```js
[ [5, 9], [5, 3] ] => [ [5, 3], [5, 9] ]
```

This library does not mutate the inputs. In theory, a function in JavaScript could mutate its arguments, but only if they are on an "object" primitive type (an array or a plain object, for example).

### Options object

| `options` object's key             | Type     | Obligatory? | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {                                  |          |             |         |
| `strictlyTwoElementsInRangeArrays` | Boolean  | no          | `false` | If set to `true`, all ranges must have two and only elements, otherwise error is thrown. For example, input being `[ [1, 2, 'zzz'] ]` would throw (3 elements), as well as `[ ['a'] ]` (1 element). |
| `progressFn`                       | Function | no          | `null`  | If a function is given, it will be called with natural number meaning percentage of the total work done. It's approximate and used in worker setups.                                                |
| }                                  |          |             |         |

**Output:** Sorted input array. First, we sort by the first argument of each child range array, then by second.

Here is whole Optional Options Object in one place, with all defaults, in case you want to copy it:

```js
{
  strictlyTwoElementsInRangeArrays: false,
  progressFn: null
}
```

Let's discuss it.
- If you tried to use this package, but something didn't work out, also [raise an issue](<https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/issues/new?issue[title]=ranges-sort%20package%20-%20put%20title%20here&issue[description]=**Which%20package%20is%20this%20issue%20for**%3A%20%0Aranges-sort%0A%0A**Describe%20the%20issue%20(if%20necessary)**%3A%20%0A%0A%0A%2Fassign%20%40revelt>). We'll try to help.
- If you want to contribute some code, fork the [monorepo](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/) via GitLab, then write code, then file a pull request on GitLab. We'll merge it in and release.

In monorepo, npm libraries are located in `packages/` folder. Inside, the source code is located either in `src/` folder (normal npm library) or in the root, `cli.js` (if it's a command-line application).

The npm script "`dev`", the `"dev": "rollup -c --dev"` builds the development version retaining all `console.log`s with row numbers. It's handy to have [js-row-num-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-row-num-cli) installed globally so you can automatically update the row numbers on all `console.log`s.
